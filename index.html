            I am student of data analysis and management at the University of Nebraska
            at Omaha in Omaha Nebraska. I am incredibly rusty at working with HTML and CSS and this project has been 
            a bit of a nightmare for me. It's probably not helped by the fact that I waited until the last minute to actually
            work on it so really it's no ones fault but my own. Life is pain :)

            This is a sample site to demonstrate nonexistent HTML and CSS skills. These skills are critical to developing
            my web applications and thus far it's shaping up to be a rough one.
