# 3900-Activity2
The goal of this activity was to show a basic level of skill with HTML and CSS by creeating a very simply two page web site that contains at least one image.
The example provided contained information about the prefessor and her pet dog, so I made mine about the same thing (i.e. myself and my dog.)
The home page contains a picture of me and my roll in the university as well as a link to the second page that contains information on and images of my pet dog "Moose."
